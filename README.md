# TEA Backend
This repository contains the core of TEA backed by GraphQL.

## Setup
Clone this repository.
Run `yarn` or `npm install` from the cloned directory.
Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the server.

### TO-DO
- `graphql-merge-schemas` will not work with graphql > 0.11.7. Hence, using `graphql v0.11.7`. Once `graphql` releases `0.12.4`, upgrade the graphql and check.
